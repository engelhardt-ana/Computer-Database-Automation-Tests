This test suite is based on Java and Selenium with tests-script for testing https://computer-database.gatling.io website.

I have decided to use page object model to organize this test suit. For building tool I have chosen Maven.

Project structure:
pageObject package :
AddEditComputerPage - I have written all xpath/ids and methods for the Add and Edit page
MainComputerPage - all xpath and methods for the Main page

In the BaseTest class I have 2 methods that have executed before and after each test runs, the first is BeforeTest setup of ChromeDriver and the second is AfterTest that use driver.quit method to close browser.

Because I use POM model, to hide the implementation so the framework will not be linear, I have written All Selenium methods inside methods in classes.

I have use variables for xpath/ids because if the developer will change HTML/CSS code, we can easily change them and maintain tests.
Also I have used %s for xpath to prevent duplicated code, and it is easier to change this kind of xpath or variable.

Test package :
Contains of 18 test grouped by product functionality.
Each test have Test in the name of the class and javadoc to describe the test.
